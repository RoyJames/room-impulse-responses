# room-impulse-responses
A list of publicly available acoustic/room impulse response (AIR/RIR) datasets. Currently this repo only tracks real-world recorded room impulse responses. Datasets included here may contain other data (e.g., speech, noise) in addition to RIRs. But this repo only describes the datasets about their RIR contents below. While there may be other webpages (if not outdated) that list some of the RIR datasets, this repo provides a brief description about the content of each dataset so you don't have to download and inspect them one by one before realizing it is not what you desire.

This repo also provides some scripts for downloading datasets if possible. Some dataset may require registration to download, which we may not provide download links directly. Only rows marked with a :heavy_check_mark: are directly downloadable by running `./get_all_rirs.sh [destination folder]`.

For getting spatial RIRs in ambisonic format (i.e., `.sofa`), please refer to [another dedicated website](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)).

# Contribute
Collecting real-world impulse responses is not easy. This repo tries to keep up with new real-world datasets available through volunteers. If you know publicly available datasets that are not listed here, you are welcome to create a pull request by adding a new entry to the list (and optionally the script to download & organize it). When writing the description, please highlight how many IRs and environments and what channel format are invovled in this dataset.

# Reference
Please properly cite whichever datasets you use in your paper. It would be great if you can also provide a link to this page (e.g., as a footnote, not a citation) so that others may find it useful.
