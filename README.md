# room-impulse-responses
A list of publicly available acoustic/room impulse response (AIR/RIR) datasets. Currently this repo only tracks real-world recorded room impulse responses. Datasets included here may contain other data (e.g., speech, noise) in addition to RIRs. But this repo only describes the datasets about their RIR contents below. While there may be other webpages (if not outdated) that list some of the RIR datasets, this repo provides a brief description about the content of each dataset so you don't have to download and inspect them one by one before realizing it is not what you desire.

This repo also provides some scripts for downloading datasets if possible. Some dataset may require registration to download, which we may not provide download links directly. Only rows marked with a :heavy_check_mark: are directly downloadable by running `./get_all_rirs.sh [destination folder]`.

For getting spatial RIRs in ambisonic format (i.e., `.sofa`), please refer to [another dedicated website](https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_(Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics)).

| [HOMULA-RIR](https://github.com/polimi-ispl/homula-rir) | HOMULA-RIR is a dataset of room impulse responses (RIRs) acquired using both higher-order microphones (HOMs) and a uniform linear array (ULA), in order to model a remote attendance teleconferencing scenario. Specifically, measurements were performed in a seminar room, where a 64-microphone ULA (Eventide-Polimi eStick) was used as a multichannel audio acquisition system in the proximity of 2 speakers (Genelec 8020), while HOMs (Voyage Audio Spatial Mic) were used to model 25 attendees actually present in the seminar room. | 2024 | [HOMULA-RIR: A Room Impulse Response Dataset for Teleconferencing and Spatial Audio Applications Acquired through Higher-Order Microphones and Uniform Linear Microphone Arrays](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSPW62465.2024.10626753) | :heavy_check_mark:
| [SRIRACHA](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/d9d4b747-2f3e-4b21-b32e-48863e9af876) | The SRIRACHA dataset comprises room impulse responses of spatially distributed sources within a plane parallel to a planar microphone array measured in a shoebox room with changing absorption. It consists of 2,654,720 single-channel room impulse responses divided into eight different scenarios. A combination of two source-receiver plane distances, two different source arrangements, and two different absorption levels of the shoebox room was measured. The dataset is intended to serve as a benchmark for data-driven modelling and interpolation methods for room impulse responses. | 2025 | [SRIRACHA: Shoebox Room Impulse Response Archive with Varying Absorption](https://api-depositonce.tu-berlin.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/643a8b38-bc2e-43cb-89e8-f972ed4457f8/content) | :heavy_check_mark:
| [GTU-RIR](https://github.com/mehmetpekmezci/gtu-rir) | GTU-RIR dataset, comprises more than 15,000 room impulse responses (RIRs). To collect this dataset, we developed a semi-automated sound recording system, and the entire process of constructing this system and extracting the RIRs is thoroughly explained in our GitHub repository(https://github.com/mehmetpekmezci/gtu-rir) | 2024 | [GTU-RIR - Gebze Technical Universiry Room Impulse Response Dataset for Acoustic Learning](https://gtu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mpekmezci_gtu_edu_tr/Ec9dwMtiymlOuu_NSv5yT0YBeLwiFk8lwdhBpWrSCtPcZg?e=Xu50ok) | :heavy_check_mark:
| [MIRACLE](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/b079fd1c-999f-42cb-afd2-bcd34de6180b) | The MIRACLE dataset contains a total of 856,128 single-channel impulse responses acquired across four different measurement scenarios with a planar 64-channel microphone array. A regular grid of 64 × 64 source locations was sampled for two different source plane to microphone array distances. The dataset also contains measurements on a densely sampled 33 × 33 grid for the short distance, as well as measurements with the presence of a reflective panel. | 2023 | [MIRACLE - Microphone Array Impulse Response Dataset for Acoustic Learning](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13636-024-00352-8) | :heavy_check_mark:

# Contribute
Collecting real-world impulse responses is not easy. This repo tries to keep up with new real-world datasets available through volunteers. If you know publicly available datasets that are not listed here, you are welcome to create a pull request by adding a new entry to the list (and optionally the script to download & organize it). When writing the description, please highlight how many IRs and environments and what channel format are invovled in this dataset.

# Reference
Please properly cite whichever datasets you use in your paper. It would be great if you can also provide a link to this page (e.g., as a footnote, not a citation) so that others may find it useful.
